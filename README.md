## My process

- First examined the design images to understand the layout and the pieces of the card. I concluded it was a very basic page requiring just HTML and CSS, no need of Javascript or a framework
- I added all necessary content to the HTML file
- Finally started styling, starting from the root with resets, then body with the given font family, background color and font size then finally the card itself

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I better understood how to calculate inner border radius with this challenge.

### Continued development

- The box shadow
